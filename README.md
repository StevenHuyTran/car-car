## Design

## Step by step installation and getting started
1. Fork the repository 
2. Select clone with HTTPS, and copy the link
3. Clone the repo using Terminal: git clone "repo-link"
4. Change your directory to the newly cloned repo: cd "repo-name"
5. To open project in VSCODE : code .
6. Run : docker volume create pgdata
         docker-compose build
         docker-compose up
7. If you run docker-compose up and if you're on macOS, you'll see
   a warning about an
   environment variable named OS being missing. You can safely ignore this.
8. Once docker is up and running, go to http://localhost:3000/ to
   see the web app.
